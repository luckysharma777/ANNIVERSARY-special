          Loveüíñ,
          <br />
          Happy 6 months anniversary, meri jaan ‚ù§Ô∏è

It feels unreal yet so magical that we‚Äôve completed six months of our journey ‚Äî all without meeting even once. But somehow, our love has grown stronger with every passing day. I never knew long-distance love could feel this deep, this real, and this powerful until I found you. Every time I hear your voice, every time you call me ‚Äúbaby‚Äù or ‚Äúmeri jaan,‚Äù my whole world lights up. You‚Äôve become my reason to smile, my peace in chaos, and my hope on tough days.

Even without your physical presence, you‚Äôve become the most important part of my life. Every moment spent talking to you, laughing with you, or dreaming about our future feels precious. I miss you more than words can explain, but I know the wait will be worth it. I imagine that first moment we meet ‚Äî I‚Äôll run to you, wrap you in the tightest hug, and never let go. That hug will hold all the emotions we‚Äôve felt through screens and words ‚Äî the love, the longing, the connection.

After we meet, I want to do every cute thing we‚Äôve ever dreamed of ‚Äî going on late-night walks, holding hands at sunset, sharing ice creams, taking silly selfies, and watching movies cuddled together. I want to plan spontaneous dates, bring you flowers just because, and dance with you in the rain. I‚Äôll give you soft forehead kisses, wrap you in cozy hugs, and whisper ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù every single day. I want to know every little detail of your day, see your smile in person, and be there for every high and low.

These 6 months have taught me what true love is ‚Äî patient, strong, and full of faith. We‚Äôve built something so pure and unbreakable, despite the miles between us. I genuinely want to spend the rest of my life with you. I want to see you every morning, fall asleep beside you every night, and live a life full of laughter, dreams, and togetherness.

You‚Äôre not just a part of my life ‚Äî you are my life. I love you endlessly, and no amount of distance or time can change that. You‚Äôre the one I see in my future, in every plan, every dream. You make me feel loved in ways I never knew were possible. I promise to keep loving you with the same intensity, the same madness, and the same devotion ‚Äî always.

I‚Äôll wait patiently for the day we meet, because I know it will be the most beautiful moment of my life. And once we‚Äôre together, I‚Äôll never let you feel alone again. Until then, meri jaan, just know that you are deeply loved, missed, and treasured more than words can ever explain.

Forever yours,
Your baby üíï
